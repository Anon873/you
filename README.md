 # Best Practices
  To get the most out of this script you should maintain these things.
  * Don't use HEADLESS mode. Because no IP leak prevention, fingerprint defending, etc. can be done in headless mode.
  * Youtube doesn't count views from the same IP after a certain time. Like, don't expect to get 100 views from 10 proxies. If you want more views, try to use a lot of premium proxies(free proxies are flagged by most websites). DO NOT use TOR proxies.
  * Use both [urls.txt](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer#urls) and [search.txt](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer#search)
  * And use as many [urls](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer#urls) and [keyword::::title](https://github.com/MShawon/YouTube-Viewer#search) as you can. Don't use just one video.
